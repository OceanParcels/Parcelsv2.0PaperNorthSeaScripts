This repository contains the files necessary to run and postprocess the simulations studying the sensitivity of North West European continental shelf floating microplastic distribution.

The master file is `northsea_mp.py` that calls, using the different parameters, the simulation code `run_northsea_mp.py`. The kernels defining the particle dynamics are implemented in `northsea_mp_kernels.py`.

All postprocessing scripts and useful functions are stored in the `postprocess` directory.
